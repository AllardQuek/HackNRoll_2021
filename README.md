# Ramsii Bot

**_Want to cook but missing an ingredient? Ask Ramsay!_**

We created a Telegram bot using python-telegram-bot and deployed it on Heroku. 
Since we wanted to provide users different types of substitutes, we had to set up our own database using sqllite to store the different ingredients. 
Additionally, to implement features such as Food Trivia, we used Spoonacular, a Food API, to query responses.
